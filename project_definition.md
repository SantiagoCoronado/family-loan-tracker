- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid styling and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight, no complex frameworks
- **Service Worker**: Offline functionality and caching

#### **Backend & Database**
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
- **Row Level Security**: Built-in data privacy and access control
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live updates across all connected devices
- **Authentication**: Secure user management with JWT tokens

#### **Hosting & Deployment**
- **Netlify**: Serverless hosting with automatic deployments
- **GitHub Integration**: Continuous deployment on code changes
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for fast loading
- **HTTPS**: Automatic SSL certificates

#### **Data Structure**
```javascript
loan = {
  id: UUID (auto-generated),
  user_id: UUID (references auth.users),
  original_amount: INTEGER (in cents for precision),
  remaining_balance: INTEGER (in cents),
  monthly_payment: INTEGER (calculated: original_amount / payment_plan),
  payment_plan: INTEGER (1-12 months),
  loan_date: DATE,
  concept: TEXT (optional description),
  payments_made: INTEGER (auto-calculated),
  status: ENUM ('active', 'paid'),
  payment_history: JSONB (array of payment objects),
  created_at: TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}

payment_history_item = {
  id: UUID,
  date: ISO_STRING,
  amount: INTEGER (in cents),
  concept: TEXT (optional),
  type: ENUM ('monthly', 'flexible'),
  strategy: TEXT ('oldest_first', 'manual'),
  remaining_balance_after: INTEGER
}
```

### **7. Core Calculations & Logic**

#### **Payment Calculations**
- **Monthly Payment**: `original_amount / payment_plan`
- **Due This Month**: Based on loan date, elapsed months, and payments made
- **Payment Allocation**: Complex algorithm for distributing flexible payments
- **Progress Calculation**: `(original_amount - remaining_balance) / original_amount * 100`
- **Interest-Free**: Simple principal-only calculations

#### **Business Rules**
- **Oldest First**: Flexible payments always pay oldest loans first
- **Overpayment Handling**: Excess amounts carry forward to next oldest loan
- **Auto-Status Update**: Loans marked as 'paid' when balance reaches zero
- **Payment Validation**: Ensure payments don't exceed remaining balances

### **8. User Experience Features**

#### **Form Validation & UX**
- **Real-time Validation**: Instant feedback on form inputs
- **Smart Defaults**: Current date, reasonable payment plans
- **Error Prevention**: Validate before submission
- **Success Feedback**: Clear confirmation of successful operations

#### **Interactive Elements**
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental deletions or large payments
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback during database operations
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive success/error messages
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive feedback on clickable elements

#### **Accessibility & Responsive Design**
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for smartphone usage
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for easy mobile interaction
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **High Contrast**: Readable colors and proper contrast ratios
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse

### **9. Development & Deployment Strategy**
